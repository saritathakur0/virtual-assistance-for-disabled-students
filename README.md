# virtual-assistance-for-disabled-students
The objective of this project is to provide assistance to disabled students with the help of
volunteering. The world is aware of the missing opportunities present among disabled students,
thus they lack behind even after having brilliant brains. This not only keeps them behind, but
also contributes to decline of literacy rates and youth domination. Also these disabilities as well
as lack of opportunities kills their inner will of studying and growing. We believe that if they get
one chance in their lives to prove themselves, they would surely.Thus this system gives an
opportunity to the needy students to find volunteers who can help them appear their
examinations in a fair manner. This ensures equal opportunities for all kinds of students. Any
student who wishes to appear for examination, can search for volunteers who would help them.
Similarly, interested students or people can register themselves as volunteers, and would get
assigned their job as requested. This makes the use of various technologies available to make a
good cause.
